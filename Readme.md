## Automation Test Smart Web

#### Built using protractor and javascript

### Instructions

1. install protractor(I assume as it was second choice you already have it)
2. open terminal
3. run webdriver-manager update (so you are up to date if not already)
4. run webdriver-manager start
5. navigate to folder
6. run protractor conf.js

### Challenges

1. #### Sahi Pro

   I actually got a response rather quickly but had some trouble on my machine with the setup so I decided to go with option 2, Protractor. I plan on revisting sahi and giving it another shot now that this is done.

2. #### POM

   Although I have had some exposure to testing frameworks I had not previously employed the Page Object Model. But previous experience with fameworks like React were similar enough that it made sense quickly.I think it does help prevent redundancy and improve readability like components do.

3. #### The search button

   I could probably target it elsewise but the button to search had the same classname and cause some issues early on but I figured it out.
